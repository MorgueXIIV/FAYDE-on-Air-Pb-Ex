2,WATERFRONT / DOOR / BALCONY,
3,Find booze and drink it,"The hangover feels really bad. You have to take the edge off. Find a bottle of alcohol, put it in your hand (equip it in the HELD slot in your INVENTORY), and the magic will happen by its own!"
4,Replace lost boule,"Due to some confusion over the game René and Gaston are playing, you threw one of their pétanque *boules* far in the sea. The shot was excellent, but now you owe them a *boule*... or at least similar-looking metal sphere."
5,Make truce with Cuno,"You tried to punch Cuno and failed catastrophically. Now you need to make a truce with him to gain access to his knowledge. Offer him something he might like. Smokes? A ""Man from Hjelmdall"" book?"
6,Find your other shoe,Seems like your green snakeskin shoe is missing its partner. You should find it before you go venturing into the wild unknown. Two shoes are better than one -- unite them again.
7,Interview cafeteria manager,The cafeteria manager of the Whirling-in-Rags might know something about the murder that happened in the yard. Ask him about it.
8,Inspect victim's body,"Inspect the body hanging in the back yard of the Whirling-in-Rags. This is a preliminary inspection, you just need to suppress the urge to throw up and approach it."
9,Report your badge missing,You need to report your missing badge to the 41st Precinct as soon as possible. The lieutenant said that you can use the radio in his motorcar to call your station.
10,Find money for rent and pay Garte,"You need to find 20 reál to pay for your room at the Whirling, or it will be locked after 21.00. As long as you don't have a free place to stay you have to do this every night."
11,Pay for damages,"You need to pay for the damages you caused in the Whirling-in-Rags, or you won't have a place to stay tonight. Ask around for money and be careful with your spending. If you're unsure how much you owe, ask Garte."
12,Find smokes and smoke them,"You need to get your hands on some cigarettes and then smoke them... for those massive bonuses. Find a pack, put it in your hand (equip it in the HELD slot in your INVENTORY), and the smokes will do the rest."
13,Getting the body down,"Somehow make it so that the bloated corpse isn't up there any more. Shoot it down or ask for help. Do something, you're a cop."
14,Find working class husband,"The working class woman you met in front of the bookstore admitted that her husband is missing. Chances are the guy is drinking somewhere with his buddies. Find him and bring him home, if possible."
15,Talk to Garte for Sylvie,"Sylvie asked you to talk to Garte and tell him she's sorry. Go to the cafeteria manager and relay the news, maybe it will help you somehow?"
16,Talk to Joyce about the pale without Kim,"Lieutenant Kitsuragi does not want you to hear about something called the *pale*, probably thinking it will prove traumatic. Return to Joyce once he is not there, and ask her about it. *Or* get him to step away for a second."
17,Track down your badge,"It's unclear how you should go about finding a tiny piece of plastic in a world as huge as this. Maybe you'll just *stumble* across it, down the line? Miracles happen."
18,Add even more beauty to the wall,"You have seen an exceptionally beautiful wall in Martinaise, near the pier, and have decided to add to its beauty, artistically. This will take a brush first? Who would have one? Then paint, and then the act itself."
19,Open trash container,"There's a locked trash container behind the Whirling-in-Rags. The manager, Garte, should have a key. Alternatively, you could use brute force to pry the lid open. You just need a prybar."
20,Interview the Wild Pines rep,"Find the representative of the logistics company who owns the harbour, and ask her about the murder. She should be around here somewhere..."
21,Interview the Union boss,"Enter the harbour and seek an audience with the local Débardeur's Union leader, Evrart Claire -- you need to ask him about the murder in his District."
22,Perform field autopsy,"The hanged man is down. Perform a closer inspection of his body, arriving at cause of death. This will need a form to be filled, in three parts."
23,Find out who is in the Union box,"Garte has told you some unruly Union men gather in the mess hall of the Whirling-in-Rags. They're not there today, but most likely they'll eventually show up -- keep an eye out for them."
24,Speak to the assault victim,Go upstairs and knock on the door #3 to talk to the supposed victim of the hanged man. See what she has to say to you.
25,Ask about Ruby in the village,"Titus said Ruby -- the instigator of the lynching -- has a shack she rents on the coast. First go across the waterlock (south of Martinaise), then walk down the coast until you find a little fishing village. Ask around, the locals must have seen her."
26,Return to the Whirling-in-Rags,Return to the Whirling after the whole Instigator debacle. Someone there has something to answer to.
27,Go to the island,"Go to the islet in the bay. There could be a boat in the fishing village, on the coast. Ask there."
28,Run the number on the victim's armour,You discovered a serial number on the victim's ceramic armour boots. Run the number using lieutenant Kitsuragi's shortwave in his motor carriage.
29,The Jam Mystery,"Someone's using Terminal B to smuggle raw ingredients of drugs into Revachol. Joyce said there are 3 drivers at the intersection. Talk to them, one of them *must* know something about the drug trade."
30,Call your station's lazareth,"Kim suggested you call the station lazareth in order to sort out your health issues. You can use his motor carriage to make the call, although you don't feel hopeful."
31,Investigate Doomed Commercial Area,People say the commercial building on the plaza is cursed; no business will ever thrive there without going bankrupt. You promised Plaisance you'll look into it. Enter the sealed door behind the bookstore and find out what happened to the companies there.
32,Find your paperwork,Officers of the RCM carry a ledger with paperwork -- find yours so you'd be able to take official notes. Look around the yard. Something makes you think it's there.
33,Who put the clothes in the trash?,"The victim's clothes were in the trash container out back, neatly folded. Who could have put them there, and why? Only the Whirling staff was supposed to have the key."
34,Style your paperwork,"You and your Conceptualization skill have decided to style that paperwork so it'd be cooler somehow. Be on the lookout, but know -- this will take *time*."
35,Read your ledger and name the case,"This case needs an official name. Go to your INVENTORY, and INTERACT with the Damaged Ledger to give it one. (Finding the right line may take some time.)"
36,Wash off the death smell,You reek of death. Wash it off. There's a bathtub in your room in the Whirling-in-Rags. A good place to visit once you can have some privacy.
37,Help Revachol Ice City cut losses,Help Revachol Ice City cut their losses by plugging out the giant ice bear fridge. It's located in the cellar of the Doomed Commercial Area.
38,End-of-day debrief with Kim,"Kim can answer any lingering questions you may have about the case and the RCM. Join him on the Whirling-in-Rags' balcony after 22:00, when you're calling it a day."
39,The Missing Insects Case,"Some locusts have gone missing, and the Insulindian phasmid has yet to be found. Perhaps you can use your detective skills to help out the cryptozoologists?"
40,Find the traffic hooligan,"A half-insane joyrider has jumped over the canal. See if you can find evidence of his reckless activity in west, on the coast."
41,Meet Lilienne at Land's End,"You have a date with Lilienne. Get to Land's End -- in the northern tip of the peninsula -- quickly, she's not going to wait for you forever."
42,Joyce's info on the lynching,"There is something she wants to tell you -- you just have to present her with your badge to hear it. *Or* perhaps if you did her a favour she could wave off the formality? Whatever the case, you need to know what she knows."
43,The victim's tattoos,"You have a photo of the hanged man's tattoos. Maybe someone can decipher them, tell you what they mean? You should probably talk to about two people about them for this."
44,Open apartment door for Evrart,"Evrart asked you to open the basement door behind the greenhouse in the backyard, to intimidate the occupant. Do what you have to do, Evrart has promised to give you info on the case in return."
45,Get two signatures for Evrart,"Get Isobel and Lilienne in the nameless fishing village down the coast to sign Evrart's document. Once the signatures are secured, mail the document to Evrart's accountant using the mail box on the plaza in front of the Whirling."
46,Get Joyce to tell you about discovery of Insulinde,"Joyce has said she will tell you about the discovery of the Insulindian isola, one day. You have a feeling you need to tell her things in return -- things you do for Evrart, maybe?"
47,Send victim's body to processing,"Once you're done with it, send the corpse to Processing (lieutenant Kitsuragi will take care of it). Check twice to see whether you're done with all corpse-related tasks -- after you've sent the body away, you can't take it back."
48,Find speed and sniff it,"The hangover is coming on *mega* strong now. You need more speed in your bloodstream. Find some, put it in your hand (equip it in the HELD slot in your INVENTORY), and off we go!"
49,Who made the call reporting the crime?,"Someone reported the hanging to the RCM. Maybe if you find out who it was, it may shed new light on the events. You have an idea where to start, but the caller could have been anyone."
50,Ask Klaasje about Sunday night,"When Kim's not around to stop you, ask Klaasje about what she heard from her room the night before you emerged into Reality. She must know something."
51,Explore the Whirling’s secret passages,"There are strange doors in the Whirling. No one knows where they lead. Find a way in and see what's hidden there, in the hostel cafeteria's forgotten corners."
52,Sing karaoke,"You need to find a sufficiently tragic tape, then play it on a boombox to memorize the lyrics. Then ask the cafeteria manager to perform. (Preferably in the evening. More people at the bar then.)"
53,Pick up dice from the Dicemaker,Dicemaker said that your order will be ready in 8 hours. Pick it up from the Doomed Commercial Area and be sure to have some money with you.
54,Interview the Sunday friend,"You finally met up with the mysterious smoker on the balcony. He said the one you really want to talk to is his friend. This friend is waiting for you inside, in apartment #28 -- go and and meet him right now (he won't be there later)."
55,What is anodic music?,"You should find out what is this *anodic dance* music people are listening to these days. Maybe if you were to stumble upon some young adults later on? This is a long term side-thing, don't fret it."
56,Doorgunner Megamix,Hardie gave you a recording where the hanged man supposedly testifies to his intent to rape and pillage. Have a listen on a playback device -- either in your room; or find one from a pawnshop.
57,Help ravers start a nightclub,"The ravers asked you to help turn the church into a dance club, but there are already some people inside. Find out who those people are and what they want."
58,Question Klaasje about the dead man,"Klaasje told you she can't talk about him now, but you need *specifics* -- height, build, etc, to confirm your autopsy. Ask a little later, when she has collected herself."
59,Sync the sines with Noid,"Noid doesn't want to talk to you, the sines are not in sync. Guess you need to help him and his friends out somehow, prove that you're one of the crew. Who knows what he'll tell you?"
60,Make Titus give up Ruby's location,"Ruby was the organizer of the hanging. She's also *missing*, but the Hardie boys will be tight-lipped about her location. You need to get them to open up. Have you *fully* explored the Whirling? Analysed the site of the murder? Truly and *thoroughly* interrogated Klaasje? All this might make convincing them easier."
61,The *special* borscht,What's so *special* about the borscht the strikers are eating? The cook in the *Whirling-in-Rags* is making it -- you can find him in the kitchen. Look into it.
62,Inspect Klaasje's buoy,"There's a buoy West of the boardwalk on the coast, somewhere in the reeds. It has Miss Oranje's fake documents in it..."
63,Solve the Egg Head puzzle,"There has to be some way to talk to this person, you just haven't found it yet. (It's definitely not about sines.) What if you just try again, find your way out of this maze of things to say?"
64,Confront Hardie boys about drug trade,"A person present at the lynching is also involved with the drug trade through the harbour, which links them to Hardie's boys. See what Titus has to say about it."
65,Get Acele to talk about her associates,Acele refused to talk about her friends. Maybe she'll open up later -- after you've helped them set up the nightclub.
66,Arrest Klaasje,There is a hidden way to arrest Klaasje and have Kim take her to Precinct 57 for safe keeping. She is not to be trusted.
67,Find solution to strike deadlock,"There is a secret way to solve the deadlock. It's not easy, includes a lot of back and forth between the two sides, but it's possible. Everything is always possible."
68,Are you La Puta Madre's peone?,"Ruby said you were a notoriously corrupt cop. La Puta Madre's peone. That's why she was scared of you. When you get the chance, call your station to find out more -- *if* you dare."
69,Light the graffito on fire with a burning cigarette,What it says on the can.
70,Ask Lilienne's twins about the island,Lilienne mentioned they might have been there on a raft -- the twins are on the concrete yard in the middle of the village.
71,Find fuel for the generator,"Find fuel, then put it in the generator upstairs (to power the console -- to open the door). There could be fuel on the island, tucked away somewhere -- explore, look around."
72,Hardie and the Pigs,"Ask Titus Hardie and his boys to take care of the Pigs -- the woman catatonic on the boardwalk. It's their district, their mess -- their responsibility."
73,Ask Evrart about Acele and the drug lab,Acele said Evrart is connected to the drug operation in the church. Maybe you can use this to manipulate him.
74,Extract a confession from the Deserter,You need at least three examples of proof to show that you have him anyway. There is little point in his resistance.
75,What is the Race Enigma?,"Put the Advanced Race Theory idea into a free *internalizing* slot in your head. (If there are no free slots, free one up). Then pass some time and when it's internalized, return to Measurehead. This is how thinking is done!"
76,Buy FALN pants from Cuno,"Those FALN track pants looked enticing, but you and Cuno were not *close* yet. You need to figure out what's going on with him and then you can get your hands on some performance gear."
77,Get the whole story from Titus,Hardie and the boys know the whole story. It'll be difficult to get it out of him. Have you thoroughly inspected the body? Looked around for a witness? Gotten friendly with the Union boss and the company rep? *Really* gotten to Klaasje?
78,Return Lena's pin,Lena gave you a commemorative pin to pawn when you were desperate for cash. The *honourable* thing to do would be to return it to her -- buy it back and return it to her once you have money.
79,Pay Lena back for pin,Lena gave you a commemorative pin to pawn when you were desperate for cash. You could pay her back once your financial situation isn't quite as pitiful. Finished when you give Lena what the pawnbroker paid you for the pin.
80,Get a reality lowdown,You have no idea where you are. Lena encouraged you to ask others to explain the world to you in greater detail -- perhaps try a rich person? Rich people are educated.
81,Find your heraldic bird,"The working class woman said that you're a bit of a cockatoo. What if it's true? Go read up on cockatoos in the bookstore, maybe you'll discover something new about yourself as well."
82,Take stuffed bird to Garte,"Garte was fixing a stuffed bird. You've found another stuffed bird, not the same bird but not broken either. Take it to him in the Whirling-in-Rags. Perhaps he can hang it up on the wall."
83,Report the dead body to the station,"Another dead body, this time on the Martinaise boardwalk on the coast. You don't have time to look into it. Someone at the lieutenant's station can handle it. Call and let them know what you found -- after you've examined the body for clues."
84,Dead body on the boardwalk,"Another dead body, this time on the Martinaise boardwalk on the coast. Search the man's remains and follow the leads to see if you can verify his identity."
85,Offer figurines to Dolores Dei,"Dolores Dei was fond of figurines. She deserves more. You should offer her any and all you have one day, if you meet her in person. What an odd task to give yourself -- but here we are."
86,Find the murder weapon,"You need to find the firearm that killed the hanged man. Something tells you it will take *some* time. You could start by identifying the bullet, so you'd know the weapon that shot it. After that, keep your eyes open. And be patient."
87,Rest in the flak tower,"Your damaged physique has earned its rest, no matter what thoughts and dreams it may bring."

90,Inform Dicemaker about the Source of Doom,"Soona's research has led you to discover a 2 mm origin point of pale in the Dolorian Church of Humanity down the coast.

This might be negatively affecting the entire neighbourhood, including the Doomed Commercial Area where Plaisance works. Tell her about it."

94,Ask gardener about gardening in March,"The young woman with the wheelbarrow at the corner of the Whirling-in-Rags told you that she had to take a break from gardening because of the cadaver smell. But what if she was lying? After all, what kind of *gardening* is done in *March*?"
95,Find one armour piece,You really just want one piece of the armour... it's enough. Find and locate one piece and this one's done.
96,Find all armour pieces,"You want all of the armour pieces. Deck yourself out in full metal battle-hardened glory. NOTE! This might take a while. Like, a *long* while."
97,Investigate apartment #10 for the cleaning lady,"The cleaning lady said the apartment should be empty, but there's definitely someone inside. Could it be *counterculture people*? Investigate and report back to the cleaning lady in the apartment building's hallway."
98,The Return,Use the boat to return to mainland.
99,Fridge victim's body,"You need to buy yourself more time to find whatever you're missing in the corpse. A fridge would allow you to preserve the body longer. Ask the Whirling, Frittte, or maybe Cuno, or some other local kids?"
100,"Find Morell, the Cryptozoologist","The ageing cryptozoologist has been out in the reeds for too long, and his wife, Lena, is very worried. Maybe you can find him when you happen to be on the coast?"

103,Help Soona with her project,"Soona will cooperate with the ravers' nightclub plan... if you help her out with the research project first. Find the filament memory with an off-site copy from her old workplace and bring it back to her, then wait for further instructions. If you run into any problems you can always ask for Soona's help."
104,Make van Eyck's jam harder core,"You can feel it -- this music could hit so much harder. It just needs a few tweaks... Walk back to the canal and see if you can find any tapes that could work as a melody, then bring them back to Egg Head for remixing."
105,Getting the Hanged Man's boots,"In order to succeed 1) the body has to be down, 2) autopsy has to be finished, 3) and Kim has to be absent (he wouldn't approve). This will be *devilishly* tricky, so don't beat yourself up if you manage to send the body to the processing without getting hold of the boots."
106,Inspect the phasmid,"Go to it, carefully... it may be dangerous."
107,The smoker on the balcony,You met a mysterious stranger smoking on the balcony of the apartment building north of Martinaise. He knows something about the murder. Find out where he lives and question him again.

109,Confront the Pigs and get your gun back,Someone's been running around with your sidearm pretending to be a police officer. You must meet her near the old fish market at 22:00 and get your service weapon back. Just walk past the fishing village until you see the boardwalk.
110,Track down your gun,"Someone must know something about your lost firearm. Maybe a district authority, like someone high up in the Union? Or someone local, who saw you with it before you passed out -- the Whirling's absent bartender? You could also ask the local pawnshop."

112,Question Klaasje about the tape,"You refused the tape Hardie offered you, wherein the hanged man supposedly testified his intent to rape and pillage. Does Klaasje know anything about the recording? You should ask her -- unless you like loose ends."

115,Read the watermarks,Get in front of Kineema's headlights to read the halogen watermarks in your ledger. This may yield some information about who you are.
116,Ask Kim to tell you about the case,"Police officers get *briefed* about the cases they're given. Sometimes they *forget* the briefing, though, and need to be briefed again! Click on Kim and ask him about the case."
117,Ask 'Scab Leader' about tattoos,"Perhaps another mercenary can tell you more about the hanged man's tattoos, the so called 'Scab Leader' at the harbour gates. It won't count as one of the people informing you about the tattoos, but could be... interesting?"

124,Where is the rest of the armour?,The hanged man's armour seems to be missing. Find out what happened to it. The kid throwing rocks at the corpse seems to be a good place to start. (Ask him about the body first.)
125,Close the water lock on Wednesday,"To get to the coast you need to use the panel to close the water lock. It's been blocked, pending repairs, which should be done by Wednesday morning. (This will open up a new area in Martinaise.)"
126,Prove your authority to Titus Hardie,"You have to gain authority in Titus' eyes for the investigation to advance. Soften him up first. Maybe investigate the crime scene, or the body? Look for a witness? Get help from the Union boss, or the company rep? Tie them to any other crimes?"
127,Ask René about the photo,"The photo you found in the nightwatchman's booth -- the one with a happy couple. Ask René about it, he looked uncharacteristically happy in the picture."

130,Look for Ruby on the coast,"Ruby was in the cinderblock village but left Monday. She could be anywhere on the peninsula, north of the village. Look inside the church. Ask around, there are people to the west of the mural. Or, I don't know... ask a girl on a date? Then ask her? Ask the wind maybe?"
