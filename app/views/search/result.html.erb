<h2> Search </h2>
<p> This is in extreme alpha, so probably only returns really literal searches </p>
<p> To prevent abuse (or the strain on the server if you legitimately want to search for everything containing "a") this will only return a maximum of 500 results. If this limit is too low for a good-faith search, contact me and I'll reconsider it! (I assume you know who I am, this is a niche)  This limit does not exist in the desktop FAYDE, because it's more efficient, and will only slow down own computer if you try too hard; so for intense research, I recommend that route. </p>
